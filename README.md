About SNotepad
	While you enjoy the features of top modern notepad apps like multiple
	notes management and search, SNotepad doesn\'t save notes in a special
	database but instead directly on internal storage or SDCard. That
	means you need not to worry about backing up your	valuable notes or
	export them every once in a while in case you changed your phone
	or lost it. You can also define the save path in settings dialog.
	You can even give	it address of your owncloud folder if you have
	OwnCloud app installed. Therefor you can have all your notes backed up
	by OwnCloud.
	
	It takes a lot of time and effort to write a software. If you found
